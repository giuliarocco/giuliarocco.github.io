I am a biomedical engineer specializing in non-invasive **neuroimaging** and **biomedical signal processing** for functional brain mapping using functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (**fNIRS**), functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (**fMRI**), and Electroencephalography (**EEG**).

As a **Marie Curie Doctoral Fellow** at Université Côte d’Azur (France), I conducted studies that pioneered the use of non-invasive multimodal imaging to explore the cerebellum. My research has been recognized by grants and international awards, including first place in the [Falling Walls Lab MSCA 2021](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/event/falling-walls-lab-msca-2021) with the opportunity to attend the Science Summit in Berlin being featured as one of the 75 [International Emerging Talents](https://apply.falling-walls.com/people/giulia-rocco/).

My experience spans leading **international research** institutions, including Politecnico di Milano (Italy) and Concordia University (Canada), and diverse domains, from **neuroscience** to **psychophysics** and **wearable** technology. I have contributed to projects that have implemented novel speech intelligibility tests, assessed heart rate variability, electrodermal activity and eye tracking for applications ranging from stress and emotion detection to biomarketing and virtual-reality-based therapy.

Proficient in **multimodal data analysis**, I use advanced quantitative methods, including high-dimensional **time-series** modeling, **frequency domain** analysis, **regression models**, and **inverse problems** for **source reconstruction**. I am a fast learner with a proven ability to design and execute complex **experimental research** studies across **interdisciplinary teams**.

<!-- Passionate about science communication, I deliver talks, workshops, and presentations, making complex scientific topics accessible to diverse audiences. I effectively communicate technical concepts, engaging with academic and non-specialist communities to foster scientific and industrial collaboration. -->
